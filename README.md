# 👋 Hi, I’m Abraham (sonOfDocker)

Full-stack software engineer with a strong Java foundation, modern JavaScript skills, and growing depth in Python and data pipelines.  
I enjoy building **reliable, data-driven systems** that power **consumer-facing experiences**, with an emphasis on clarity, scale, and long-term maintainability.

## 🧠 What I’m working on now

### 🚀 Pegasus Finance & Data Pipeline
A privacy-first data ingestion and analysis system designed to turn messy, real-world inputs into clean, actionable insight.

**Why it matters:**  
At its core, Pegasus is about **transforming raw data into trustworthy information** — the same challenge faced by large consumer platforms, media companies, and experience-driven products.

**Highlights:**
- Python-based ingestion & normalization pipeline
- Local-first architecture with Dockerized Postgres
- Designed for:
  - multi-user households
  - extensibility across data domains (finance, commerce, usage metrics)
  - future visualization & insight layers
